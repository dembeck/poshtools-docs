## Profiling Support 

{% hint style="info" %}
 Profiling support is in preview. Please report any issues at [https://poshtools.com/issues](https://poshtools.com/issues).
{% endhint %}

As part of the [PowerShell Pro Tools module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/powershellprotools/1.3.0), profiling support has been integrated into the [PowerShell Pro Tools VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ironmansoftware.powershellprotools). You can use the `PowerShell: Profile Script` command to execute the profiler on the currently active PS1 file.

  
The profiler will annotate the the script is information about the performance and call count of each of the pipelines within the script.

If you wish to remove th code anontations, you can use the `PowerShell: Clear Profiling Information` and your editor will be back to the state it was in before profiling.

  
You will need to install the latest version of the PowerShell Pro Tools module for this functionality to work.

### Limitations

Being an early version of the profiler, there are some limitations.

#### **Single Script Support**

The profiler only profiles the current script. It will not profile scripts or modules that you reference. If you use functions within pipelines in your profiled script, those functions will be timed but their internal operations will not.

Hot Path Support

Although the hot path information is available in the output from the profiler, there is no visual representation of this information.  


#### Pipeline Element Timing

The profiler has early support for pipeline element timing but does not expose this in this version.  
For example, a pipeline like the one below will result in a single timing even though multiple commands are being called.

```text
Get-Process | Select-Object Name | Out-String  40.85% (1 calls)
```

In a future version, individual commands will be able to be profiled.
