# 0.7.0

## PowerShell Core Packaging

You can now create executables from PowerShell scripts that can run on machines without PowerShell Core or .NET Core installed. The packager will automatically include the PowerShell Core engine and .NET Core runtime with the script and any dependent modules. 

Learn more about PowerShell Core Packaging from [this blog post](https://poshtools.com/2019/01/14/self-contained-powershell-scripts/).
