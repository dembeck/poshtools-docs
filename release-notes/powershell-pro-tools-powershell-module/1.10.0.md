## Profiling Cmdlets

**The PowerShell Pro Tools module now provides cmdlets to profile PowerShell scripts. You can use `Measure-Script` to analyze the performance of a script. The profiler instruments the PowerShell code automatically and records timings for pipelines within the script.  
Currently, the best way to view script output is with the VS Code extension for PowerShell Pro Tools.**

## Bundling of Referenced Assemblies

`Merge-Script` has been enhanced to bundle assembly references along with other artifacts in a script. If you use `[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom()` within your script, `Merge-Script` will automatically base64 encode the assembly into your output executable.
