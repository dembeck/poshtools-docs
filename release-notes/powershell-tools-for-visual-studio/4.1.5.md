# 4.1.5

## Fixed an issue where applying a new license would not work

When applying a new PoshTools Pro license over the top of a trial license would not work and the trial license would remain. 

## Fixed an issue with bundling assemblies using Add-Type

If a script contained a call to Add-Type in the following format, the assembly would not be bundled correctly. 

```text
Add-Type -Path (Join-Path -Path ($PSScriptRoot) -ChildPath "Test.dll")
```
