# 4.1.6

## Fixed a crash in the Windows Forms designer

The forms designer would present an object reference exception while attempting to work with the designer. 

## Fixed an issue with the System.Drawing Reference

When a new form is created in a project and the project does not have a reference to System.Drawing, a reference is automatically added. This reference pointed to an invalid path resulting in an invalid reference that would require the user to manually fix the reference.
