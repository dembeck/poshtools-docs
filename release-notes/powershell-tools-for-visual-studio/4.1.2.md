# 4.1.2

## Fixed Classification Service

The classification service could fail when first opening a Visual Studio solution that contained a PowerShell script.

## Fixed race condition with IntelliSense service

The IntelliSense service could start before the PoshTools package was fully loaded causing it to fail.
