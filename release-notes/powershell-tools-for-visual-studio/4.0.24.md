# 4.0.25

## Customize settings for PSScriptAnalyzer 

You can now specify a PSSA setting or setting file in the options for PowerShell Tools. This option effectively sets the `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` `-Setting` parameter.

## CanStop Property for Service Packaging \(Pro\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Also applies to 1.9.0 of the PowerShellProTools module. 
{% endhint %}

If you set a CanStop variable within your Service script, the packager will honor this setting and provide it to the Service Control Manager thus preventing your service from being stopped. 

```text
$CanStop = $false
```

## Fixed an issue with multiple script analyzer classifier services being added

Several issues were raised where a "Duplicate Key" exception would be presented to the user. This could happen in a number of different ways but was due to the PSSA classification service being registered twice. 

## Disable Script Analyzer for the Interactive Window

PSSA is no longer run on the PowerShell Interactive Window.
