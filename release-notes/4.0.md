## Locals Window Has Been Fixed

The locals window was not displaying local variables. 

## Release notes window has been removed

The release notes window will no longer show when PoshTools is updated. It would sporadically show for some users when attaching to a process. 

## Embedded Form Resources are now packaged correctly \(Pro\)

When packaging a Windows Form PowerShell script that included an embedded resource, like an icon, an error would be generated and the icon would not be present when bundling or packaging the script.
