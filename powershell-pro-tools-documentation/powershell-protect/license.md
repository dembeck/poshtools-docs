PowerShell Protect requires a PowerShell Pro Tools or PowerShell Protect license. You can request a trial or purchase a license from [our website](https://www.ironmansoftware.com). Each machine running PowerShell Protect will need a separate license.&#x20;

## Install a License

The license should be included in the module installation directory and named `license.lic`.&#x20;
