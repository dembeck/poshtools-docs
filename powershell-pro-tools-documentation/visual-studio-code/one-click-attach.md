# One-Click Attach

Within the PowerShell Pro Tools action panel, you can expand the Host Processes node to view processes that are running PowerShell on your machine. If you expand the processes you will see the runspaces that are currently allocated within that process. You can then click the Attach Runspace command to attach the debugger to the selected runspace.
